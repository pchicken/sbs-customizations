userstyles and userscripts for sbs frontends

## how to use

### haloopdy frontend (smilebasicsource.com)

files in haloopdy/ are compatible.  
the userjs and usercss settings can be found in `User tab of sidebar -> Developer Options`  
you can use https://pchicken.github.io/collection to get what you want nicely

### 12 frontend (smilebasicsource.com/12)

files in twelve/ are compatible.  
there are no userjs and usercss settings, so use browser extensions.  
for firefox and chromiums (including edge), i recommend violentmonkey and stylus
