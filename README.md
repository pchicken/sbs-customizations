# sbs-customizations
userstyles and userscripts for sbs frontends

## how to use

### haloopdy frontend (smilebasicsource.com)
files in haloopdy/ are compatible.  
the userjs and usercss settings can be found in `User tab of sidebar -> Developer Options`
i think i'll make a pretty selector for these later.

### 12 frontend (smilebasicsource.com/12)
files in twelve/ are compatible.  
there's no userjs and usercss settings, so use browser extensions.  
for firefox and chromiums (including edge), i recommend violentmonkey and stylus
